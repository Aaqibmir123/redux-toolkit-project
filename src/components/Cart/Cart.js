//why we can t send http request inside reducers in redux toolkit


// Toolkit are designed to be pure functions, which means they should not have any side effects. 
// Sending an HTTP 
// request is a side effect and therefore cannot be done inside a reducer.

//what are pure functions in redux


// Pure functions in Redux are functions that return the same 
// output for a given input and do not cause any side effects. 
// They are also known as 'deterministic' functions, meaning 
// that they always produce the same output for a given input. 
// Pure functions do not modify the state of the application or
//  have any external 
// side effects, such as making an API call or accessing a database.
